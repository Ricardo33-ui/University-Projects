# Projects-and-Works

Hello! In this repository, you will find two files.

The first file is a Jupyter Notebook containing a school project aimed at creating an educational document on Deep Learning and Image Segmentation, specifically focused on image detection.

The second file is the report of my internship presentation as part of the Dual Degree Program at Centrale Sup√©lec. This internship involved research on the use of machine learning tools for Affective Computing, creating a model that uses speech data to identify emotions based on the Circumplex Model, which represents emotions in a two-dimensional space with axes for Arousal and Valence. The goal was to leverage speech analysis and machine learning techniques to create an accurate tool for identifying emotional patterns indicative of depression, potentially aiding in early diagnosis and intervention in mental health care.
