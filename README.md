# Projects-and-Works

Hello! In this repository, you will find two files.

The first file is a Jupyter Notebook containing a school project aimed at creating an educational document on Deep Learning and Image Segmentation, specifically focused on image detection.

The second file is the report of my internship presentation as part of the Dual Degree Program at Centrale Sup√©lec. This internship involved research on the use of machine learning tools for Affective Computing.
